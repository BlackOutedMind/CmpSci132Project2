Voting system


##Project Tasks
• Task 1: Collect Votes cast from counties in the County_Votes.csv and determine the sum of votes for candidate in each state.  
• Task 2: Convert the votes to % win for Buggs Bunny (BB) and for Road Runner (RR) in each

• Task 3: Determine who won the popular vote (ie. who had the most votes across the entire United States).  
• Task 4: Read in the information for each state, including the number of Electoral Votes from the file State-Info.csv.  
• Task 5: Award Electoral Votes for each state to the winner of the state with the highest number of votes BB or RR.  
• Task 6: Determine who won the Electoral Vote tally  
• Task 7: Accept the State ID and list all of the summary info for the state with winner, totals and electoral votes awarded.  
• Task 8: Print a summary chart like the one below.  
• Task 9: Accept a date/time showing when the results were in. List the summary results: o Who was leading in the popular vote (BB Votes vs. RR Votes) o Who was leading in the Electoral Vote (Note, you only count the states with all counties reported in before that time. o Summarize in a report along with the Time, above results, % of state votes reported.  
• Extra Credit Task 1 [ +5 points] : Write a function to “call a state” before all the results are in.  
• Extra Credit Task 2 [+10 points] : Using matplotlib, plot all counties with a dot showing if Buggs
Bunny (green) or Road Runner (magenta) was the winner. (Hitn: Use the latitude and
longitude for this)  
• Extra Credit Task 3 [+10 points]: Plot the state’s county results for the State ID entered as part
