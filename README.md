# Overview
Computer Science project 2
Voting system


## Project Tasks

1 ✅ (Paige's File) Task 1: Collect Votes cast from counties in the County_Votes.csv and determine the sum of votes for candidate in each state.  
2 ✅ (Paige's File) Task 2: Convert the votes to % win for Buggs Bunny (BB) and for Road Runner (RR) in each
state.  
3 ✅ (Paige's File) Task 3: Determine who won the popular vote (ie. who had the most votes across the entire United States).  
4 ✅ Task 4: Read in the information for each state, including the number of Electoral Votes from the file State-Info.csv.  
5 ✅ Task 5: Award Electoral Votes for each state to the winner of the state with the highest number of votes BB or RR.  
6 ✅ Task 6: Determine who won the Electoral Vote tally  
7 ✅ Task 7: Accept the State ID and list all of the summary info for the state with winner, totals and electoral votes awarded.  
8 ✅ Task 8: Print a summary chart like the one below.  
9 ✅ Task 9: Accept a date/time showing when the results were in. List the summary results: o Who was leading in the popular vote (BB Votes vs. RR Votes) o Who was leading in the Electoral Vote (Note, you only count the states with all counties reported in before that time. o Summarize in a report along with the Time, above results, % of state votes reported.  
10 Extra Credit Task 1 [ +5 points] : Write a function to “call a state” before all the results are in.  
11 Extra Credit Task 2 [+10 points] : Using matplotlib, plot all counties with a dot showing if Buggs
Bunny (green) or Road Runner (magenta) was the winner. (Hint: Use the latitude and
longitude for this)  
12 Extra Credit Task 3 [+10 points]: Plot the state’s county results for the State ID entered as part of task 7  

## Changes made - Nov/01/2024
- Updated Readme
- Separeted Main.py into countiesFunction.py and popularVote.py
## Changes made - Nov/05/2024
- New file `ExtraFunctions.py` -> Has different functions for the code so they are re-usable, and better organization
- New File `Voting_project02.py` -> Burner code, testing ground for avoiding breaking the main program
- Obsolete: `main.py`, `countiesFunction.py`, `popularVote.py`
## Changes made - Nov/09/2024
- Code being completly rewritten, from the ground up.
